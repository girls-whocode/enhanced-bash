  I would recommend to name it like this to keep it easy to understand:
  or_{comp}_{name}

  or is required for the system to understand this is a file that is needed to load.
  {comp} is the component type such as module, library, ect.
  {name} is any given name to tell you what it is or does.

  * /overrides/or_lib_mylibrary
  * /overrides/or_mod_mymodule
